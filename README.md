# pyWONE
The idea of this project is to create a application that leverages the REST API of Workspace ONE to make administrators life easier. It's being built around a SaaS environment and I'm not sure how it'd work on-prem.

# Usage
Haven't decided on best approach yet.

# Clean code, security, logging..
As this is a language I'm currently learning (very slowly) there might be some obvious security/performance traps I fall into or perhaps miss something important. Feel free to inform me. This will be used in a production environment I work in but I recommend you to do your own research when it comes to security.

# Request a function?
I'm open to requests but I'll limit myself to functions that could be of use for me. I also have limited time to work on this.
